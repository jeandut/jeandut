Hi 👋 I am Jean I work with R&D in topics related to Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Federated Learning applied to HealthCare.
I am currently a Lead Research Scientist at [Owkin](https://owkin.com/) where I try to [connect knowledge from distant hospitals while respecting patient privacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02155-w) to answer long-standing medical questions in Oncology. To this end I use data from multiple modalities such as clinical, histological, survival and genomics. I am a firm believer in open research and published in top-tier venues such as Nature Medicine (1 paper), NeurIPS (2 papers), ICML (1 paper), MICCAI (1 best paper) and ICIP (1 paper) and wrote numerous surveys and technical reports all publicly available :arrow_right: [Link to scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IFj7SkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).  

In the past few years I've also been:

👨‍🎓 a Ph.D. student in the defense sector working on Object Detection algorithms for [Safran](https://www.safran-group.com/) (2016-2018) 

👨‍💻 an intern at [Anametrix](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ensighten-acquires-marketing-analytics-firm-anametrix/) applying Data-Science to web-analytics (2015-2016) 

👨‍🔬 a summer student at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) in the [CMS department](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) (2013) 

:man_teacher: a student from [Supelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (2012-2015)



I recently open-sourced [the FLamby repository](https://github.com/owkin/FLamby) to provide FL researchers with datasets and tools to come up with better strategies to train Machine Learning in privacy preserving healthcare context.
If you are interested in Federated Learning do not hesitate to check it out and to add a star if you like it.
