Hi 👋 I am Jean I work with R&D in applied topics related to Machine Learning (Computer Vision, Federated Learning, Time-series Forecasting, LLMs, ...).

I recently left my job as Research Team Lead at [Owkin](https://owkin.com/) where I [tried to connect knowledge from distant hospitals while limiting patient exposure](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02155-w) to try to answer long-standing medical questions in Oncology. To this end I used data from multiple modalities such as clinical, histological, survival and genomics. 

I am now experimenting with large-scale machine learning exploring foundation models with various data modalities like time-series, language and genomics data.


I am a firm believer in open research and published in top-tier venues such as Nature Medicine (1 paper), Nature Communications (1 paper), NeurIPS (3 papers), ICML (1 paper), MICCAI (1 best paper), Nature Scientific Reports (1 paper), ICIP (1 paper), wrote numerous surveys and technical reports all publicly available ( :arrow_right: [Link to scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6IFj7SkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) ) and wrote many publicly available code such as [FLamby](https://github.com/owkin/FLamby) and [FedECA](https://github.com/owkin/fedeca). 

In the past few years I've also been:

👨‍🎓 a Ph.D. student in the defense sector working on Object Detection algorithms for [Safran](https://www.safran-group.com/) (2016-2018) 

👨‍💻 an intern at [Anametrix](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ensighten-acquires-marketing-analytics-firm-anametrix/) applying Data-Science to web-analytics (2015-2016) 

👨‍🔬 a summer student at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) in the [CMS department](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) (2013) 

:man_teacher: a student from [Supelec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) (2012-2015)



As Federated Learning in healthcare is extremely hard to setup in real life I open-sourced [the FLamby simulation repository](https://github.com/owkin/FLamby) to provide FL researchers with datasets and tools to come up with better strategies to train Machine Learning in privacy preserving healthcare context.
If you are interested in Federated Learning do not hesitate to check it out and to add a star if you like it.
